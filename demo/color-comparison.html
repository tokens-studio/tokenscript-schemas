  <h1>🎨 TokenScript Color Conversions</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Visual comparison with ColorJS • Generated 12/19/2025, 3:22:53 PM</p>
  
  <!-- Explanation -->
  <div class="explanation">
    <h2>What is this testing?</h2>
    <p>
      This page compares <strong>TokenScript</strong> color conversions against <strong>ColorJS</strong> (the reference implementation).
      Each color goes through a conversion chain, and we verify the output matches ColorJS within tolerance (< 1e-6).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>TokenScript (TS)</strong> = Our implementation running in the TokenScript interpreter<br>
      <strong>ColorJS (CJ)</strong> = Reference implementation from <code>colorjs.io</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Swatches:</strong> Side-by-side CSS-rendered colors. If they look identical, the conversion is correct.
      Some spaces (like HSV) aren't CSS-supported, so we show a placeholder.
    </p>
